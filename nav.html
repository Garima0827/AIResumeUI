                    <p>The light blinded him. It was dark and he thought he was the only one in the area, but the light
                        shining in his eyes proved him wrong. It came from about 100 feet away and was shining so
                        directly into his eyes he couldn't make out anything about the person holding the light. There
                        was only one thing to do in this situation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a
                        flashlight of his own that was much stronger than the one currently blinding him. He turned it
                        on and pointed it into the stranger's eyes.</p>
                    <h3>Title 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Her hand was balled into a fist with her keys protruding out from between her fingers. This was
                        the weapon her father had shown her how to make when she walked alone to her car after work. She
                        wished that she had something a little more potent than keys between her fingers. It would have
                        been nice to have some mace or pepper spray. He had been meaning to buy some but had never
                        gotten around to it. As the mother bear took another step forward with her cubs in tow, she knew
                        her fist with keys wasn't going to be an adequate defense for this situation.</p>
                    <p>
                        No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened. It
                        didn't even really make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter
                        how hard he tried to react, nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had
                        instantly become a statue and although he could see what was taking place, he couldn't move to
                        intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even though it was the truth.</p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes it's just better not to be seen. That's how Harry had always lived his life. He prided
                        himself as being the fly on the wall and the fae that blended into the crowd. That's why he was
                        so shocked that she noticed him.</p>
